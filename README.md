# MultiThreadedGameDemo
A simple 2D Asteroids like game that I made to demonstrate multi-threading to the Open Source programming club at Salt Lake Community College.

The most interesting thing about this project is the way I calculated the drift of your spaceship once you release the movement key. The ship keeps moving but slows to a stop. I also used a bit of trigonometry to calculate the angle of exceleration, etc.

Multithreading was used to separate the rendering process and input handling.
